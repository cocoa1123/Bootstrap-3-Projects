						<h2>Halkidiki, Greece - The perfect break</h2>
						<hr></hr>
						<p class="text-justify">
							Why go? For its heart-stopping beauty and fabled hospitality. Halkidiki's trident of forested peninsulas – Kassandra, 
							Sithonia and Athos – form more than 300 miles of white-sand coastline that dip into a crystalline Aegean, so it was only a 
							matter of time before the birthplace of Aristotle attracted more than toothbrush-wielding archaeologists, or monastic types 
							en route to Mount Athos. However, unlike the Greek islands, relatively restrained development has left Halkidiki largely unspoilt. 
							It is also at its best during spring. Temperatures are already nudging 20C, the sea is warm enough to swim in, and the hills 
							are covered in a glorious display of wild flowers.

						<h2>Thassos, Greece - The Pearl of Aegean Sea</h2>
						<hr></hr>
						<p class="text-justify">
							 Is there anything better than whiling away the day on a gorgeous beach…on a tranquil island…with the sun high in the sky? 
							 We think not! For many of us, a great beach is the reason we choose our Summer holiday destination – it’s often more 
							 important than the hotel we’re kipping in at night. And for good reason! With up to 12 hours of sunshine per day during 
							 high season, the beach is where we’ll spend the majority of our time, and make those much cherished holiday memories.
							Thassos’ beaches are many and varied – with long sandy stretches and quiet coves to suit every kind of holidaymaker, 
							young or old, coupled-up or with the family.

						<h2>Best Beaches in Crete Island</h2>
						<hr></hr>
						<p class="text-justify">
							Information about the Beaches in Crete island, in Greece but also information about beaches in many locations of the island: 
							Crete is the largest island of Greece and its coastline of 1,046 m (650 miles) provides hundreds of beautiful beaches. 
							Located between the southern side of Aegean Sea and the northern side of the Libyan Sea, Crete gets very popular in summer due 
							to the gorgeous beaches, the traditional lifestyle of the locals and the beautiful nature. 
							Among the most exotic sandy Crete beaches is Balos, a wonderful place in Chania with crystal Caribbean-like water. 
							This place amazes visitors with the stunning natural beauty. Another of the most beautiful beaches of Crete is the exotic 
							beach of Elafonissi in Chania, on the westernmost spot of Crete, as well as the long, sandy beach of Falassarna. Finding a 
							perfect beach is not a problem for visitors, as there are nice clean beaches in Crete all around the island. Some Crete beaches 
							are organized and others are secluded, but all are clean.

						<h2>Best Beaches in Mexico</h2>
						<hr></hr>
							<p class="text-justify">
								Mexico has a multitude of beach destinations, some which were Mexican towns which gradually gained popularity as tourist 
								destinations and others which were conceived as resort towns from the outset. These popular Mexico beach destinations offer 
								powdery sand and crystalline water along with an abundance of tourist amenities and attractions.
								If you'd rather spend your beach vacation somewhere that's just as gorgeous but not so crowded, you may prefer to visit one 
								of Mexico's less well-known beach destinations: Mexico's Secret Beaches.

						<h2>Bora Bora Beaches...</h2>
						<hr></hr>
						<p class="text-justify">
							Dreaming of a tropical vacation on Bora Bora beaches? Imagine glimmering, turquoise, lagoon water...for as far as your peripheral 
							vision can see. Surround it with white sandy beaches, fringed by a ring of vivid green, palm studded motus.
							Turn around 180 degrees. More electric blue, calm water, edged by powdery white beaches. And behind them, rising mysteriously 
							out of the sand...exotic Bora Bora Island.
							When I first showed my Bora Bora photos to friends, everyone asked me if they had been 'photo-shopped.' The answer is 'No'.
							The water really is that color, only better, when you are there!
							The vivid shades of emerald, turquoise, azure and royal blue are mesmerizing! The beaches here are even more beautiful than 
							pictures can convey. They are the reason I have become a Bora Bora Island addict.

						<h2>There's A Glow-In-The-Dark Beach In The Maldives.</h2>
						<hr></hr>
							<p class="text-justify">
								Taiwanese photographer William Ho was able to catch these phenomenal images on a recent honeymoon trip -- and we're so glad he did.
								Ho was traveling through Mudhdhoo Island, and these particular photos were captured during his stay at luxury resort Dusit Thani.
								Cornell biology professor James Morin tells The Huffington Post that the organisms creating the glow in the Maldives are in fact 
								"ostracod crustaceans" although they've been commonly mistaken for phytoplankton.
								Morin further explains that these ostracods emit light for a longer time than the organisms previously believed to be in the 
								photos, bioluminescent phytoplankton. While phytoplankton emits light for no more than a second, usually when something comes 
								into contact with the water, ostraccods emit light for seconds to even a minute or longer.
								The sight of thousands of glowing specks scattered along the beach's sand is believed to be a mass mortality of these organisms 
								that periodically occurs in the Maldives.
